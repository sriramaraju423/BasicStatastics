Measure of dispersion or second moment business decision:
Sample formula of Varience and standarad deviation differs by n-1 when compared to population. 
Reason: 
Bookish: Sample has some amount of bias hence we reduce that bias by subtacting by 1 point in denominator.
Nitin sir: We intuitively select mean when choosing sample from population.
Expected value of mean & Variance of probability distribution are signma X * p(x); sigma(x-mu)^2*p(x)
